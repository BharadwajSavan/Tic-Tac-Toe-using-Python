# Tic-Tac-Toe-using Python (udemy milestone project-1)

Breaking-down the project into individual functions:

**Step 1: Write a function that can print out a board. Set up your board as a list, where each index 1-9 corresponds with a number on a number pad, so you get a 3 by 3 board representation.**

**Step 2: Write a function that can take in a player input and assign their marker as 'X' or 'O'. Think about using while loops to continually ask until you get a correct answer.**

**Step 3: Write a function that takes in the board list object, a marker ('X' or 'O'), and a desired position (number 1-9) and assigns it to the board.**

**Step 4: Write a function that takes in a board and checks to see if someone has won.**

**Step 5: Write a function that uses the random module to randomly decide which player goes first. You may want to lookup random.randint() Return a string of which player went first.**

**Step 6: Write a function that returns a boolean indicating whether a space on the board is freely available.**

**Step 7: Write a function that checks if the board is full and returns a boolean value. True if full, False otherwise.**

**Step 8: Write a function that asks for a player's next position (as a number 1-9) and then uses the function from step 6 to check if its a free position. If it is, then return the position for later use.**

**Step 9: Write a function that asks the player if they want to play again and returns a boolean True if they do want to play again.**

**Step 10:Use while loops and the functions you've made to run the game.**
